    <q>I HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, <span id="to raise the Ghost of an Idea" class="phracoll think">to raise the Ghost of an Idea</span>, which shall not <span id="put my readers out of" class="phracoll">put my readers out of</span> humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.
      <span id="May it" class="phracoll">May it</span> haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.

    <h3>MARLEY’S GHOST.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>
      Marley was dead: to begin with. There is <span id="no doubt" class="phracoll think">no doubt</span> whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk,
      the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon ’Change, for anything he chose <span id="to put his hand to" class="phracoll">to put his hand to</span>.
      Old Marley was <span id="as dead as a door-nail" class="idioms">as dead as a door-nail</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, <span id="of my own knowledge" class="phracoll">of my own knowledge</span>, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been <span id="inclined" class="think">inclined</span>, myself,
      to <span id="regard" class="think">regard</span> a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the <span id="wisdom" class="think">wisdom</span> of our ancestors <span id="is in the simile" class="phracoll">is in the simile</span>; and my unhallowed hands
      shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore <span id="permit me to" class="phracoll">permit me to</span> repeat, emphatically, that Marley was <span id="as dead as a door-nail" class="idioms">as dead as a door-nail</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t know how many years.
      Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.
      And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully <span id="cut up" class="phrasal">cut up</span> by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business <span id="on the very day of" class="phracoll">on the very day of</span> the funeral,
      and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mention of Marley’s funeral <span id="brings me back" class="phrasal">brings me back</span> <span id="to the point" class="phracoll">to the point</span> I started from. There is <span id="no doubt-" class="phracoll think">no doubt-</span> that Marley was dead.
      This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can <span id="come of" class="phracoll">come of</span> the story I am going to <span id="relate" class="think">relate</span>. If we were not perfectly
      <span id="convinced" class="think">convinced</span> that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be <span class="phracoll">nothing more</span> remarkable in his taking a stroll at night,
      in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly <span id="turning out" class="phrasal">turning out</span> after dark
      in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to astonish his son’s <span id="weak mind" class="phracoll think">weak mind</span>...
