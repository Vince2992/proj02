  <h1><strong>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</strong></h1>

  <p>
    <strong>by Arthur Conan Doyle</strong>

  <p>
    At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
    The landlady informed me that he had left the house <span id="shortly after" class="phracoll">shortly after</span> eight o’clock in the morning.
    I <span id="sat down" class="phrasal">sat down</span> beside the fire, however, <span id="with the intention of" class="phracoll">with the intention of</span> awaiting
    him, however long he might be. I was already <span id="deeply interested" class="think">deeply interested</span> in his <span id="inquiry" class="think">inquiry</span>, for, though it
    was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes
    which I have already recorded, still, the nature of
    the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, <span id="apart from" class="think">apart from</span>
    <span id="the nature of" class="phracoll">the nature of</span> the <span id="investigation" class="think">investigation</span> which my friend <span id="the nature of" class="phracoll">had on hand</span>, there was something in his masterly
    grasp of a situation, and his <span id="keen" class="think">keen</span>, <span id="incisive" class="think">incisive</span>
    <span id="reasoning" class="think">reasoning</span>, which made it a pleasure to me <span id="to study" class="think">to study</span> his <span id="system of work" class="phracoll">system of work</span>, and to follow the quick,
    <span id="subtle methods" class="think">subtle methods</span> by which he <span id="disentangled" class="think">disentangled</span> the most <span id="inextricable mysteries" class="think phracoll">inextricable mysteries</span>. So accustomed was I to
    his invariable success that <span id="the very possibility of" class="phracoll">the very possibility of</span>
    his failing had ceased <span id="to enter into my head" class="think">to enter into my head</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span id="It was close upon" class="phracoll">It was close upon</span> four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom,
    ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes,
    walked into the room. <span id="Accustomed as I was to" class="phracoll">Accustomed as I was to</span> my friend’s amazing powers <span id="in the use of" class="phracoll">in the use of</span>
    disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he
    vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
    Putting his hands into his pockets, he <span id="stretched
    out" class="phrasal">stretched
    out</span> his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged <span id="to lie back" class="phrasal">to lie back</span>,
    limp and helpless, in the chair.
  </p>

  <p>
    “What is it?”
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never <span id="guess how" class="think">guess how</span> I employed my morning, or what I <span id="ended by" class="phracoll phrasal">ended by</span> doing.”
